# AXELROD TRADING BOT
*Trading Bot for Cryptocurrency*

## Running application

1) Install dependencies running the command: `npm install`

2) Configure the exchanges and currencies that will be monitored, in the file: `config/settings.json` 

    * *For see all opportunities, disable filters.*

3) Now, execute the command `npm start`

## Exchanges

I use the [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/Manual#exchanges) library, so all exchanges that do not require token and secret are integrated.
